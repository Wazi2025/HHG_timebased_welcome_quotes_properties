# Project "HHG_timebased_welcome_quotes_properties"

A pseudo-random Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy quote picker that asks for the user's firstname, lastname and age and picks from a list of 60 items based on DateTime(seconds).<br> I could of course have used the Random class, but that was a bit too obvious;-)
There's also a rather obvious easter egg in there.
